#Welcome to the PyDamp YAML Input Document

## PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THE KEYS, AND FORMAT
## FOLLOW THE ENTRY FORMAT SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLE
## DOUBLE CHECK YOUR INPUTS, WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN ACCURACY IN THE OSU DESIGN REPOSITORY
## SOME INFORMATION CAN BE SUBJECTIVE, PLEASE USE YOU BEST REASONING
## THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION

## ONE YAML FILE PER PRODUCT

## When using the provided indices, enter the index number that corresponds with the entry value.
# EXAMPLEl:    1 | Consumer , System_Type: 1



## USER INFORMATION
# Please provide your name. (First Last)
User_Name: Vinny Ferrero

# Are you an OSU Student? (Only yes or no will be accepted)
OSU_Student: yes

#If you are an OSU student, Who is your Advisor?
#If you are not an OSU student, What entity do you represent?
Employer: Bryony


# optional: Please enter you email
Email: ferrerov@oregonstate.edu


## SYSTEM INFORMATION
# The following section gathers the overall data for the Product

# What is the system name?
System_Name: Vacuum

#Please write a consise description of the product.
System_Description: Home appliance used for cleaning floors 

#Reference the included index table CSV to determine the System Type.
System_Type: 1



## BILL OF MATERIAL INFORMATION
#This section gathers the componennt information for the product. 

#To add more components enter a new line and follow the format

##PLEASE THE FOLLOWING THE FORMAT##
#   - [Name,Description,Component Basis,Material]

BOM:
    - [Housing,protective cover of product,50,15]
    - [Motor,converts elec. energy to pnuematic energy,115,11]
    - [Brush,sweeps up debris,46,15]
    - [Brush Housing, covers the brush spindle,50,15]
    
    
## SYSTEM ASSEMBLY INFORMATION
#This section gathers information of the child-parent relationship of the components

# A child is a component connected to another component from a top down perspective
# EXAMPLE: A housing could be a child if the system(product), a motor could be a child of a housing.

## If unsure default to naming the system (product) the parent. THE SYSTEM HAS AN INDEX OF  0

# For this section you need as many enteries as your BOM. 
# Use the index of the first component in the BOM being 1, second componet being 2 ... and so on.
## REMINDER SYSTEM INDEX IS 0 AND SHOULD BE THE DEFAULT IF RELATIONSHIP IS UNKNOWN

# In the following list please indext the PARENT of each component 
# EXAMPLE: -[Housing,protective cover of product,50,15] would have a parent of system
# the Assembly_Data for entry woulf be -0

Assembly_Data:
    - [0]
    - [1]
    - [4]
    - [0]
    
    
## SYSTEM FUNCTION INFORMATON
# Use the function index to denote the functional basis terms of each component.
# Use the index of the first component in the BOM being 1, second componet being 2 ... and so on.  
# In short, the first entry will be the function of the first component.
# Function is defined as the task the component completes 

## COMPONENTS CAN HAVE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS 
# denote this as -[#,#,#] .....etc.

Function_Data:
    - [50,52,53]
    - [35]
    - [40,15]
    - [50,52,53]
    
    
## SYSTEM FLOW INFORMATION
# This sections is used to collect advanced assembly information
# For each of the functions listed in the Function_Data you need to denote:
# the input flow, input component, the the output component, adn output flow

# - [[input_flow,input_component,output_component,outout_flow]]

## NOTE:: The input component is likely the parent component but not always
## NOTE:: The output component is likely the child component but not always
## BE CRITICAL ## 

# Use the flow index to denote the flows in and out of the function.

## Use nested lists to denote each set of flow data.
# EXAMPLE: If Function data entry one is -[#,#] then flow data entry one is:
# -[[input_flow,input_component,output_component,outout_flow],[input_flow,input_component,output_component,outout_flow]]

# If a function has mulitple flows denote that with a nested list
# EXAMPLE: If Function data entry one is -[#] but has mulitple flows then flow data entry one is:
# -[[input_flow,input_component,output_component,outout_flow],[input_flow,input_component,output_component,outout_flow]]
# -[[info1],[info2]]


# a combonation of the above examples where one of the function entry looks like this:
# - [#,#] but the second functions has multiple flows, use a  triple nest list
# info = input_flow,input_component,output_component,outout_flow
# Example: - [[info1],[[info2-1],[info2-2]]]
#         


## Not all components have flows. 
# As such if there is not clear flow information for the function please input a place holder of -[false]
# If the input flow is external of the product, input -[[#,external,#,#]]
# If the output flow is external of the product, input -[[#,#,external,#]]
## If you know there is a flow into/out of a component but do not know the orgin/destination within the system input
# unknown component input, -[[#,internal,#,#]]
# unknown component output, -[[#,#,internal,#]]


Flow_Data: 
    - [false,false,false]
    - [[34,internal,3,40]]
    - [[[40,2,external,43],[7,external,internal,7]],[40,2,external,41]]
    - [false,false,false]
